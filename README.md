# CALCULATOR README

# Introduction
This project is a web-based calculator application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It features a clean, user-friendly interface and robust functionality to handle various inputs and operations.

# Features

# User Interface:
1. Intuitive layout with a display for input and results.
2. Buttons for digits (0-9), decimal point, and operators (+, -, *, /).
3. Special buttons for "Clear" (C) and "Equals" (=).
# Functionality:
1. Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. Follows the correct order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS).
3. Responds to both button clicks and keyboard input.
# Error Handling:
Handles division by zero and other mathematical errors gracefully.

# Usage
1. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
2. Use the digit buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
3. Use the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to perform calculations.
4. Use the decimal point button (.) to enter decimal numbers.
5. Press the "Clear" button (C) to reset the calculator.
6. Press the "Equals" button (=) to see the result of your calculation.

# Code Structure
1. index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the calculator interface.
2. style.css: Contains the CSS for styling the calculator.
3. script.js: Contains the JavaScript code to handle the calculator's functionality.

# Input Handling
The calculator handles user input accurately, responding to both button clicks and keyboard inputs. Users can enter numerical values, perform calculations, and see the results on the display.

# Error Handling
The calculator includes error handling to manage cases like division by zero and other mathematical errors. When an error occurs, an appropriate message is displayed, and the calculator prevents further invalid operations until reset.
